1. Update the Subscription Using an Ofiilne File (opens a dialog to select the desired File, The format must be in JSON)
2. add a text that shows when was the last time the user updated the subscription JSON file using this tool (ex. Last time Subscription Updated: 2 Agust 11:55 pm )
3. Use a proxy server or sing box itself for updating the proxy ( this way it will help to avoid the censorship of the sub URL or IP leakage ! ) (In my opinion I would say)
4. add an option that lets the user Update the subscription to the latest version with the previous sub it provided (I would say the program saves the log and other useful stuff like the URL, and when was the last successful sub update )
5. just like X-ui in CLI it shows the sing-box version, and other useful stuff like the last successful sub update, and current sing-box.bat version and etc.
6.
